/**
 * Unified table-contribution contract (#129).
 *
 * Every table TypeGraph owns — whether modeled as a Drizzle table or
 * emitted as strategy-owned raw DDL — is described by a single
 * {@link TableContribution} shape. This is the one place that answers
 * "what tables does this backend/strategy own?", replacing the
 * previously split surfaces (Drizzle named exports, tables-factory
 * recursion, strategy raw DDL, per-table `ensureXTable` methods).
 *
 * Lives in the neutral `backend/` layer (sibling of `backend/types.ts`,
 * which `query/dialect` already depends on) and is deliberately
 * Drizzle-free, so declaring contributions does not pull the concrete
 * Drizzle backend runtime into the query/dialect layer.
 *
 * ## Identity vs. signature (prerequisite for #135)
 *
 * #135 (durable fulltext/contribution materialization) needs to make
 * "not materialized" vs. "materialized but stale" a decidable, durable
 * fact instead of an in-memory per-backend latch. That requires two
 * conceptually separate things, and #129's job is only to make both
 * *derivable* from the contract:
 *
 * - **Materialization identity** — `owner` + `logicalName` +
 *   resolved physical `tableName`. Keying on `logicalName` alone is
 *   insufficient: custom per-deployment table names must be
 *   distinguishable, otherwise two deployments with different physical
 *   names would collide on one durable marker. (#135 additionally
 *   scopes this by `graphId` at persistence time.)
 * - **Drift signature** — a hash of the strategy identity/version,
 *   the resolved table name(s), and the normalized `createDdl`. #129
 *   guarantees `createDdl` is deterministic for a given resolved
 *   configuration so the hash #135 computes is meaningful.
 *
 * The signature is intentionally **not** eagerly carried on the
 * contribution: hashing is async (Web Crypto, see `utils/hash`) and
 * #135 already owns signature persistence the same way
 * `materializeIndexes` does for declared indexes.
