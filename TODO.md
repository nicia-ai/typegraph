# To Do

- Implement a canonical notion in relationships, ex: if `partOf` is set as canonical then if a
  relationship for `hasPart` is inserted we reverse it when we store it (we may already have this,
  need to verify)
- Package LLM coding guides or an llms.txt so LLMs can effectively work with this library.
- Integration pattern for taking existing database and feeding it into the graph to index/enrich
- How can I publish the packages, consume them in a sample app and deploy to cloudflare?
- Image semantic search example
