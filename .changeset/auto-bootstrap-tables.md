`createStoreWithSchema()` now auto-creates base tables on a fresh database. Previously, calling it against a database without pre-existing TypeGraph tables (e.g. a new Cloudflare Durable Object) would throw a raw "no such table" error. The function now detects missing tables and bootstraps them automatically via the new optional `bootstrapTables` method on `GraphBackend`. Both SQLite and PostgreSQL backends implement this method. `createStore()` remains unchanged for users who manage DDL manually.
